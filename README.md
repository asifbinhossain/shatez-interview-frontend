## Introduction

This documentation provides a comprehensive guide on how we refactored the Dashboard page and implemented authorization for side-navigation items in our application. We have also outlined how we manage user roles in the system.

## Problem Statement

The task was to refactor the Dashboard page to implement authorization for the side-navigation items. Specifically, we needed to ensure that:
- Only users with the "admin" role have access to all side-navigation items.
- Regular users have limited access, with only the "Reports" section visible.

## Solution

### 1. Refactoring the Dashboard Page

We started by refactoring the Dashboard page to ensure that it can dynamically render side-navigation items based on the user's role. Here's what we did:

- Created a reusable Sidebar component that would contain the navigation items.
- Integrated role-based authorization logic within the Sidebar component to hide or show specific items based on the user's role.
- Updated the Dashboard page to render the Sidebar component, ensuring that only authorized navigation items are displayed.

### 2. Managing User Roles

We manage user roles in our application as follows:

- Upon user registration, a new user record is created in the database with a default role of "user."
- To grant admin privileges, we manually assign the "admin" role to selected users through database updates.

### 3. Authorization Logic

Authorization logic is implemented as follows:

- In the Sidebar component, we check the user's role to determine which navigation items to display.
- If the user has an "admin" role, all items are displayed.
- If the user has a "user" role, only the "Reports" item is displayed.

## Why We Chose This Approach

We opted for this approach to ensure clean code separation and maintainability. By encapsulating authorization logic within the Sidebar component, we make it easier to manage and update in the future. Additionally, manually assigning roles in the database provides flexibility for role assignment.

## Assumptions

- We assumed that the user roles "user" and "admin" are sufficient for our authorization needs.
- We assumed that the database schema supports user roles and that it can be updated to assign roles manually.

## Scaling Considerations

As our application grows and more users are added, our role-based authorization approach remains scalable. Adding new roles or extending authorization logic can be done without significant code changes. The solution can handle a growing user base and evolving authorization requirements effectively.

## Conclusion

By refactoring the Dashboard page, implementing role-based authorization, and managing user roles, we have ensured that our application securely controls access to side-navigation items. This documentation provides an overview of our approach to solving this problem, organizing data, and planning for scalability.
