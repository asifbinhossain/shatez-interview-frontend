# feature2.md - Developer Documentation

## Introduction

This documentation provides an in-depth look at how we implemented authentication in our Shatez frontend interview application, focusing on best practices, data organization, data flow, and our approach to building solutions from documentation.

## Problem Statement

The goal was to implement secure user authentication in our application using Google OAuth and to ensure that user data is properly persisted and protected. This required following best practices, organizing and structuring data effectively, managing data flow, and leveraging documentation to achieve our objectives.

## Authentication Implementation

### Choice of Authentication Method

We selected Google OAuth as our authentication method due to its security and ease of integration. We followed these steps to implement it:

1. Created a Google OAuth application in the Google Developer Console.
2. Configured OAuth settings in our Supabase project, including adding the Google OAuth client ID and secret.
3. Integrated authentication using the Supabase Auth API and the NextAuth.js library.

### Why Google OAuth and NextAuth.js?

We chose Google OAuth for its robust security and widespread user familiarity. We integrated it using NextAuth.js, a popular library that simplifies authentication implementation in Next.js applications. This approach allowed us to maintain code quality and security while minimizing development effort.

## Data Organization and Abstractions

### Prisma for Data Modeling

We organized and structured our data using Prisma, a modern database toolkit. Key steps in data organization include:

1. Defining Prisma models for our data entities, such as User and ApplicationData.
2. Generating the Prisma client code to interact with the PostgreSQL database hosted on Supabase.

### Abstractions using Repository Pattern

To create abstractions for data access, we implemented the repository pattern. This approach allowed us to:

1. Centralize data interaction logic in dedicated repository files.
2. Ensure separation of concerns between data access and business logic.
3. Improve testability by mocking repositories in unit tests.

## Data Flow Management

### Authentication-Based Data Access

We implemented data access controls based on user roles and permissions. Authenticated users can only access data they are authorized to. Key practices include:

1. Implementing middleware to protect routes, ensuring that only authenticated users can access sensitive parts of the application.
2. Validating and sanitizing data at entry points to mitigate security risks such as SQL injection.

## Building Solutions from Documentation

Our approach to building solutions from documentation includes:

1. Thoroughly reading and understanding the official documentation of technologies, libraries, and frameworks we use.
2. Breaking down implementation into manageable steps based on documentation.
3. Iteratively revisiting documentation to address challenges and optimize solutions.

## Assumptions

- We assumed a basic understanding of Next.js, Prisma, Supabase, and PostgreSQL.
- We assumed a familiarity with JavaScript/TypeScript and web development best practices.

## Conclusion

By following best practices, structuring data effectively, managing data flow securely, and leveraging documentation, we have successfully implemented authentication in our application. This documentation provides a detailed account of our approach to solving the problem and building a secure and maintainable solution.
